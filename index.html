<p> The question that I started out with before looking at the dataset was is there going to be a correleation in the price of a new card versus the price of the used car?
When I first started my thought was that the price of the new car would go up and so would the price of a used car. Once I had that started I then started with the design process.
</p>
<p> The design process for my visualization didn't turn out how I would have wanted it do, my goal with the visualization was for it to be more interactive and be able to hover over the different parts of the bar charts and see the information that went along with that car price </p>
<p> The process for making that happen was a lot more difficult than I had expected it to be, but I am happy with what I was capable of doing.
As I was able to realize that I was not going to create as good of a visualizaiton as I had hoped I dwindled it down to be what it is now. The first thing I took away was the interactive piece as I quickly discovered I was not going to be capable of that.
The next thing that I realized was going to be out of my realm was going to be labeling the different axis's to correctly correspond with what the data was.
I was able to create a axis but I was not able to make it accurate to the data so I decided it would be better to not have the axis in the first place. 
</p>
<p>
  Due to me not being able to create the visualization that I had hoped for at the beginning I wanted to make sure that I could at least figure out how to alter it to what I thought made since with the data. 
  With the data being car prices and the steady increase that we are able to see from 2019 to 2023 I thought it would be a good idea to make the visualization green to show an increase. While it may not be the increase that car buyers are wanting there was an increase.
  I decided to make the visulization as big as I did in hopes that the increase in price would be something that was visible. I know that the height difference in the bars isn't huge so I tried to make the bars bigger to make the difference at least a little visible. 
  With a lot of the bars standing for the same price as well I do think it made it a little harder to see the difference in price, but that was just a side effect of the dataset having so many data points that were the same.  
</p>
<p> Alongside with the visualization that I created on the standalone web page, in the youtube video I also created a few different visualizations with that same dataset using tableau in hopes to show I am capable of making the visualizations. </p>
